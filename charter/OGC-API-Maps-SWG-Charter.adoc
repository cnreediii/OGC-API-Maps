To: OGC members & interested parties

The OGC members listed below have proposed the re-chartering of the Web Mapping Service (WMS) Standards Working Group (SWG) as the "OGC API - Maps SWG". The OGC members listed below have proposed the "{swgname} SWG". The SWG proposal provided in this document meets the requirements of the OGC Technical Committee (TC) Policies and Procedures.
The SWG name, statement of purpose, scope, list of deliverables, audience, and language specified in the proposal will constitute the SWG’s official charter. Technical discussions may occur no sooner than the SWG’s first meeting.
This SWG will operate under the OGC IPR Policy. The eligibility requirements for becoming a participant in the SWG at the first meeting (see details below) are that:

•	You must be an employee of an OGC member organization or an individual member of OGC;

•	The OGC member must have signed the OGC Membership agreement;

•	You must notify the SWG chair of your intent to participate to the first meeting. Members may do so by logging onto the OGC Portal and navigating to the Observer page and clicking on the link for the SWG they wish to join and;

•	You must attend meetings of the SWG. The first meeting of this SWG is at the time and date fixed below. Attendance may be by teleconference.

Of course, participants also may join the SWG at any time. The OGC and the SWG welcomes all interested parties.
Non-OGC members who wish to participate may contact us about joining the OGC. In addition, the public may access some of the resources maintained for each SWG: the SWG public description, the SWG Charter, Change Requests, and public comments, which will be linked from the SWG’s page.
Please feel free to forward this announcement to any other appropriate lists. The OGC is an open standards organization; we encourage your feedback.

=== Purpose of the {swgname} Standards Working Group

The purpose of this Standards Working Group is to:

*	Develop and maintain an {swgname} core standard.
*	Develop and maintain extensions of the {swgname} standard as identified in section 4 (Scope).
* Maintain the WMS standard.

The formal proposed name of the new multi-part standard is "{swgname}". The short name “{shortname}” may also be used to refer to this effort in the charter and work products.


=== Business Value Proposition

In October 2019, the Programmable Web https://www.programmableweb.com/news/which-are-developers-favorite-apis/research/2019/10/24[reported] that a web mapping product was amongst the top-two tracked APIs on the Programmable Web API directory. The presence of a web mapping product among the top-two tracked APIs on Programmable Web is evidence of the wide interest across both the geospatial community and the general public. However, further evidence of the popularity and adoption of web mapping can be seen from the uptake of the Web Map Service (WMS) standard which is listed - as of May 2020 - as having the most implementations on the OGC https://www.ogc.org/resource/products/stats[Implementation Statistics] webpage.

=== Scope of Work

OpenAPI frameworks have helped make describing and sharing API definitions more suitable for interoperability standardization. The concept of a {shortname} was demonstrated in various OGC Innovation Program initiatives.

The {swgname} SWG will build on those preliminary efforts to more fully develop and document a {shortname} candidate standard that will provide a modernized, common, and consistent interface to services that aligns with the current architecture of the Web and the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices (https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/).

The {swgname} SWG will develop a {shortname} candidate standard which is informed by emerging OGC API best practices and prior API standards examples (e.g., OGC API - Features) to define core API functions of GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE applied to {resources} as resources. The {shortname} will also document metadata requirements for {resources} to enhance discovery and exchange of {resources}.

* Architecture: The {swgname} standard standard will align with prior OGC work for {resources} and Web APIs. The proposed standard will define API building blocks for {resources} based Web API best practices. {swgname} will be consistent with HTTP and HTTPS.

*	Encodings: The first version of the {shortname} will support JSON and HTML as encodings for descriptions of {resource} resources in the API. No encoding will be mandatory and other encodings may be used as well. The HTTP focus is designed to support the use of multiple formats and defines rules about how servers can return the encoding that the client can best handle (“content negotiation”).

* Information model: The {shortname} standard will conform to OpenAPI models and OGC API best practices. The conceptual models will consider recommendations from recent and current OGC Innovation Program initiatives such as Testbeds, Pilots, Sprint and others.

* Modularization: {swgname} - Part 1: Core will define a basic set of capabilities organized in multiple conformance classes building on each other. The minimal conformance class will specify a simple interface to access metadata from {resources} that is sufficient for interfaces to exchange and perform basic web functions with the {resources}. Additional conformance classes will define additional capabilities based on the requirements and requirements classes defined in the core to meet the needs of use cases that require such capabilities.

* Reuse: The use of unique {shortname} resources or components will be minimized and, where available, existing industry-standards or patterns that are commonly used by developers will be used instead. The most important example for this is the use of an OpenAPI definition instead of OGC-specific "Capabilities" documents and the use of OGC API - Common components to the maximum extent practicable.

Extensions may be proposed and addressed in revisions to this charter. The primary goal of the {shortname} SWG is to develop the core of "{swgname}" as quickly as possible and work on extensions after that, driven by community interest. An important aspect is to ensure that implementing the standard will lead to efficient implementations, happy developers of both server and client components, and satisfied users of such components.


Before finalizing parts of the future versions of the "{swgname}", completion of goals should be verified:

*	Working implementations of all capabilities must be available and tested; and
*	Implementation feedback must be taken into account.

A consequence of this verification is that the period between the availability of what is considered a mature draft and the finalization of the candidate standard may be longer than in the past, depending on the availability of evidence about the suitability of the candidate standard based on implementations. Developers should be encouraged as early as possible to implement the draft API specification and provide feedback. An aspect of this is public access to drafts from the beginning. To this end, the SWG intends to use a public GitHub repository in the development of this standard as this is the environment many developers are familiar with and use on a daily basis.

==== Statement of relationship of planned work to the current OGC standards baseline

This proposed standard is intended to be a major component of the OGC API framework. The proposed standard will take advantage of Web API patterns identified in OGC API standards (e.g., OGC API – Features) and other ongoing API efforts (e.g. OGC API - Common development in OWS Common SWG) to better align with current and emerging IT practices.  The {shortname} provides a means for sharing {resources} developed under OGC and other {resource} encodings.

==== What is Out of Scope?

Standards are important for interoperability. At the same time, it is important that standards only state requirements that are important for a significantly large group of users. Proposals for new parts of {swgname} or change requests to existing parts must identify the user group that will benefit from the proposal and for each proposed conformance class; otherwise the proposal will be considered out-of-scope.

{swgname} is envisioned to be a modular, multi-part standard. Extensions and profiles not identified as in scope in the previous section will require a revision to the SWG charter prior to commencement of work. If a community has a need to develop a profile, the profile should be specified and governed by that community.

The basic resource described in {swgname} are {resources}. The {shortname} describes the interface and exchange of {resources}. The construction of the main components of {resources} is addressed in multiple OGC and other {resource} encoding standards.

==== Specific Contribution of Existing Work as a Starting Point

The starting point for the work will be the draft document that is currently on the proposed SWG's repository ({githubrepo}). This charter recognises the prior work done by the {base_swg}. Upon approval of this Charter, responsibility for {swgname} and WMS standards shall be transferred to the proposed {swgname} SWG. The OGC API - Maps SWG will meet with the OGC API - Tiles SWG on a regular basis.

The work shall also be informed by the following specifications and by recommendations found in:

*	OGC/W3C Spatial Data Working Group on the Web Best Practices (https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/);
*	OGC Geospatial API White Paper [OGC 16-019r4];
*	OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core standard, [OGC 17-069r3].

Each of these documents recommends an emphasis on resource-oriented APIs in future OGC standards development including use of tools such as OpenAPI.

==== Is this a persistent SWG?


* [x] Yes
* [ ] No

==== When can SWG be inactivated?

The SWG can be inactivated once the final multipart standard has been developed and change requests become minimal or not applicable for consideration. The SWG can be re-activated at any time.

=== Description of Deliverables

==== Initial Deliverables

The following deliverables will result from the work of this SWG:

*	A final version of the "{swgname} - Part 1: Core" document for submission to the TC;
*	Identification of at least three prototype implementations of the core based on the standard — although more would be preferred; and
*	Zero or more additional parts as time and community interest permits.

Part 1 will cover basic capabilities to GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE {resources} and define {resource} metadata. Capabilities for richer {resource} interfaces or extension for unique geospatial resource considerations will be specified in additional parts.

The targeted start date is in {target_start_date} once charter is approved. Formal approval of the core {shortname} is envisaged to take place nearer {target_end_date}.

==== Additional SWG Tasks

To be completed as SWG takes on new tasks.
