== Requirement Class "Styled Maps"

=== Overview

[[styled-maps-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_styled-map.adoc[]

The Styles Map requirements class specifies how to get maps from particular resources with a style applied by _OGC API - Styles_ 1.0.

NOTE: This mechanism replaces the parameter `STYLES` in WMS 1.3 and adds the possibility to have a generic style for all layers of the service at once.

=== Styled resources
Geospatial resources can be modified or complemented by styles creating new endpoints giving access to the modified or complemented resources. The way this is done to a dataset resource or to a collection is specified in the draft _OGC API – Styles_ (as of December 2023).

include::requirements/styled-map/REQ_desc-links.adoc[]

.Fragment of a collection with a links array with one item of the array pointing to a map.

=== Styled Resource Map
Styled resources are defined by the draft OGC API – Styles Standard (as of December 2023). Nevertheless, that draft does not specify how to retrieve a map resource representing a styled resource. This section explains how to do this.

==== Map path

include::requirements/styled-map/REQ_operation.adoc[]

The Maps API Standard does not specify any additional query parameter in the GET request.

==== Response

A successful GET response is described in the Maps API core class (https://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-maps-1/1.0/conf/core).

A successful response is a map that represents the styled resource.
