^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/projection/projections-response*
^|A |The implementation SHALL include in its response for the `/projectionsAndDatums` resource the complete list of custom CRS projection operation methods supported for map retrieval operations.
^|B |The implementation SHALL include in its response for the `/projectionsAndDatums` resource the complete list of custom CRS datums supported for map retrieval operations.
^|C |In the JSON representation, the list of supported projection operation methods SHALL be provided as a dictionary (associative array) value for a `methods` property associating operation method objects
(including optional `title` and `description` properties) to the corresponding identifiers to be used as values for the `crs-proj-method` query parameter.
These operation method identifiers SHALL be safe CURIEs when a registered URI exists for the method.
^|D |In the JSON representation, the list of supported datums SHALL be provided as a dictionary (associative array) value for a `datums` property associating datum objects
to the corresponding identifiers to be used as values for the `crs-datum` query parameter.
These datum identifiers SHALL be safe CURIEs when a registered URI exists for the datum.
The datum object SHALL include an `ellipsoid` property specifying the safe CURIE for the associated ellipsoid and may contain additional optional `title` and `description` properties.
^|E |In the JSON representation, the operation method objects SHALL include all valid parameters for that  method as a dictionary (associative array) value for a `parameters` property to method parameters object
(including optional `title` and `description` properties) to the corresponding identifiers to be used as values for the `crs-proj-params` query parameter.
These method parameters SHALL be safe CURIEs when a registered URI exists for the parameter.
To avoid repeating the same parameter, those objects may use a JSON pointer (`$ref`) to a top-level `parameters` property in the same custom projections JSON document.
^|F |In the JSON representation, the operation method objects SHALL include `centerLatParam` and/or `centerLonParam` properties (as applicable) whose values SHALL be the identifiers corresponding to the parameters
for which values specified for the `crs-proj-center` query parameter will be mapped, in a manner consistent with requirement `/req/projection/crs-proj-center-definition`.
