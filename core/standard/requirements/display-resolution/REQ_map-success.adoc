^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/display-resolution/map-success*
^|A |For an implementation supporting the Maps API _scaling_ requirements class, the implementation SHALL use the `mm-per-pixel` value instead of the default 0.28 mm/pixel when establishing the relationship between the dimensions of the output image, the scale and the spatial extent of the map.
^|B |The `mm-per-pixel` value SHALL be used instead of the default 0.28 mm/pixel when establishing scale for the purpose of applying styling and symbology rules to the map. For example, this needs to be considered for scale-dependent rule selectors as well as for graphical units in real world units (e.g., meters) or display units (e.g., millimeters).
