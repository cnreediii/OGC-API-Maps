identifier:: /req/jpeg/content
part:: Every 200-response of the server with the media type image/jpeg SHALL be a JPEG document representing only one map.
part:: The colors of the JPEG SHALL represent geospatial features and/or coverage values in the map.
part:: All maps representing parts of the same resource or resources and using the same style SHALL follow the same portrayal rules.
====

NOTE: The way the colors in the JPEG are mapped to geospatial features or coverage values is out of scope of the Maps API Standard. However, a common set of portrayal rules for all maps representing part of the same resource is essential, as maps are normally represented one after the other as a response to actions of the user (e.g., zoom and pan).

NOTE: JPEG is an ideal support for remote sensing imagery. The use of JPEG to represent linear features or color solid polygons is not recommended.
