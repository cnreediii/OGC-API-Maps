^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/dataset-map/desc-crs*
^|A |The `crs` property in the landing page of a dataset SHALL contain a URI or a safe CURIE for the list of CRSs supported by the dataset as a whole.
^|B |If the dataset is available more efficiently using a particular CRS that is not https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, a `storageCrs` property in the landing page of a dataset SHALL have the URI or the safe CURIE for that CRS as a value. For example, it may be more efficient to retrieve a map in the same CRS used to store the data. Note that the native CRS is also called the _storage CRS_.
^|C |If a `storageCrs` property is used and that is not https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, an extent SHALL be provided in a `storageCrsExtent` property following the same schema as the extent property.

NOTE: A CURIE `{authority}[-{objectType}]:{id}` would map to the following OGC URI: `https://www.opengis.net/def/{objectType}/{authority}/0/{id}`. If `-{objectType}` is missing, the default object type is _crs_.
