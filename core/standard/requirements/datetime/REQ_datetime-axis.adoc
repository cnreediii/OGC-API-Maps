.A date-time (subset)
=================
February 12, 2018, 23:20:52 UTC:

`subset=time("2018-02-12T23:20:52Z")`
=================

For resources with a temporal property that is a timestamp (such as `lastUpdate`), a date-time value would match all resources where the temporal property is identical.

For resources with a temporal property that is a date or a time interval, a date-time value would match all resources where the timestamp is on that day or within the time interval.

.Intervals (subset)
=================
February 12, 2018, 00:00:00 UTC to March 18, 2018, 12:31:12 UTC:

`subset=time("2018-02-12T00:00:00Z":"2018-03-18T12:31:12Z")`

February 12, 2018, 00:00:00 UTC or later:

`subset=time("2018-02-12T00:00:00Z":*)`

March 18, 2018, 12:31:12 UTC or earlier:

`subset=time(*:"2018-03-18T12:31:12Z")`
