== Conventions
This section provides details of conventions used in this document.

=== Identifiers

The normative provisions in this standard are denoted by the URI `https://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-maps-1/1.0`.

All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this document are denoted by partial URIs which are relative to this base.

=== Link relations

To express relationships between resources, https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8288.txt[RFC 8288 (Web Linking)] is used.

Note that the CURIE based on the pattern `[ogc-rel:<relation>]` is also considered equivalent. For example, `[ogc-rel:map]` corresponds to https://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/map.

The following https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[IANA link relation types] are used in this document:

* **alternate**: Refers to a substitute for this context.

* **self**: Conveys an identifier for the link’s context.

* **item**: The target IRI points to a resource that is a member of the collection represented by the context IRI.

* **preview**: Refers to a resource that provides a preview of the link's context. In the context of this specification, it used to link to a low-resolution preview of the map.

* **service-desc**: Identifies service description for the context that is primarily intended for consumption by machines (Web API definitions are considered service descriptions).

* **service-doc**: Identifies service documentation for the context that is primarily intended for human consumption.

* **stylesheet**: Refers to a stylesheet. In the context of this specification, it refers to a cartographic stylesheet, as provided by _OGC API - Styles_.

In addition, the following link relation type is used for which no applicable registered link relation type could be identified:

* **https://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/map**: Refers to a resource that is map representation of another geospatial resource (e.g., a collection).
* **https://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/legend**: Refers to a legend for the map.

Used in combination with _OGC API - Tiles - Part 1: Core_, other link relation types will be used, including:

* **https://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/tilesets-map**: The target IRI points to a resource that describes how to provide tile sets of the context resource in map format.

Used in combination with _OGC API - Styles_, other link relation types will be used, including:

* **https://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/styles**: The target IRI points to a resource that describes how to provide styles of the context resource that internally can contain links to maps.

Used in combination with _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_ or _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_, other link relation types will be used, including:

* **https://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/conformance**: Refers to a resource that identifies the specifications that the link's context conforms to.

Used in combination with _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_ or _OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial data_, other link relation types will be used, including:

* **https://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/data**: Refers to the list of collections available for a dataset.

Each resource representation includes an array of links. Implementations are free to add additional links for all resources provided by the Web API implementing Maps API requirement(s).

=== Use of HTTPS

For simplicity, the Maps API only refers to the HTTP protocol. This is not meant to exclude the use of HTTPS and simply is a shorthand notation for "HTTP or HTTPS."
Following the recent push towards enhancing web security, public facing web servers are expected to use https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818[HTTPS] rather than https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt[HTTP].
In the context of   Maps API Standard, use of HTTPS provides a layer of security to prevent leaking of information related to users requesting map data for a particular geographical area, 
which may be private or sensitive in nature (for example, their own location, or the location of endangered species).
