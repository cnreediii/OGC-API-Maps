== Requirements Class "API Operations"

=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_api_operations.adoc[]

The "API Operations" requirements class defines requirements for providing a definition of a Web API implementing the Maps API Standard using an API definition language.
This requirements class is intended to be combined with another requirements class specifying requirements for providing an API definition in a particular API definition language and / or version,
such as the Open API 3.0 requirements class defined in https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html#_ab6e3c2d-d2dc-4f01-a7d4-8b52133289a0[OGC API - Common - Part 1 :Core], or another eventual requirements class
for OpenAPI 3.1.

=== Web API description

The API definition provides a description of the complete list of API resources available at an endpoint. Reading this description, an application would have the full picture of the resources that the API implementation provides, how to retrieve resources, and what responses are expected for successful and unsuccessful requests. Without an API description or documentation, an application would be forced to traverse all links, starting with the landing page, to get an equivalent full list of resources.

The _OpenAPI Specification 3.0 (oas30)_ requirements class from _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_ provides many details on general requirements that can be used in conjunction with this requirements class.
A later version of OGC API - Common may describe how to declare support for other versions of OpenAPI.
This requirements class depends on the _OGC API - Common_ landing page requirements class which provides details on how to request an API definition.

==== Response

===== Completeness
The API definition resulting as a response to this request need to take into consideration the relevant resources specified in the Maps API Standard.

include::requirements/api-operations/REQ_completeness.adoc[]

===== Reusable API components

Reusable components for creating API definitions for implementations of this OGC API - Maps using OpenAPI 3.0 can be found in https://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/maps/part1/1.0/openapi .

NOTE: While this specification is in draft status, the components are available from https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-maps/tree/master/openapi .

A server implementation of the _OGC API â€“ Maps Standard_ can use the content in the openapi directory to generate a response for the API description using OpenAPI 3.0.
The _ogcapi-maps-1.yaml_ includes paths and components. An implementation should only include the paths that are implemented and remove the references to the paths that are not implemented.
The components part includes parameters, responses and schemas that can be reused as-is. The `api` directory contains JSON files that are templates with enumerated values for collections, styles and tile matrix sets.
A particular implementation of the Maps API should enumerate the actual resources exposed by the API deployment in the same way.
The server can select to dynamically implement responses to /api/* (where * is replaced by all-collections, styles,... ) or hardcode the /api/* files with the actual list of resource identifiers in the enumerations.

To improve performance, the whole content of this directory can be bundled into a single document by executing a tool such as _swagger-cli_.
This document can be served for the _OGC API - Common - Part 1_ `service-desc` link from the landing page.

===== Path Operation Identifiers

The API definition provides a client application with a set of paths that the client can use to interact with the API endpoint and get new resources.
The API description of each path provides a description of what parameters to use in the request and what to expect in the response.
However, the Maps API Standard does not propose a fixed set of paths so there is an issue identifying the requirements classes pertaining to each path in an API instance.
In other words, the API description alone does not provide enough information by itself.
Therefore, there is a need to associate the resource paths in the API definition with the resources defined in the various requirements classes.
The Maps APIs Standard proposes a suffix mechanism to be applied to the operation identifiers of the path (e.g., the `operationId` property in OpenAPI Specification 3.0) to list the requirements classes pertaining to each path.
Each path should have a unique operationId suffix, so it is expected that the API instance provides a prefix to the proposed suffixes that make each operation identifier unique.
