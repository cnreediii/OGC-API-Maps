[big]*i.     Abstract*

The _OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core_ Standard defines a Web API for requesting maps over the Web.
A _map_ is portrayal of geographic information as a digital representation suitable for display on a rendering device
(adapted from https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=14416[OGC 06-042/ISO 19128 OpenGIS® Web Map Server (WMS) Implementation Specification]).
Implementations of the _OGC API - Maps_ Standard are designed for a client to easily:

* Request a visual representation of one or more geospatial data layers in different styles;
* Select by area, time and resolution of interest;
* Change parameters such as the background color and coordinate reference systems.

A server that implements _OGC API - Maps_ provides information about what maps are offered.
_OGC API - Maps_ addresses use cases similar to those addressed by the https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=14416[OGC 06-042/ISO 19128 OpenGIS® Web Map Server (WMS) Implementation Specification] Standard.

[big]*iv.    Security considerations*

OGC API — Maps — Part 1 only defines HTTP GET operations. As such the security considerations are limited to those applicable to a "read only" service. However, implementations of OGC API - Maps have to process resource paths and query parameters in a way that cannot be used by a client to inject malicious queries that makes available unforeseen data or even force the server to perform unwanted or dangerous actions. The following paragraphs enumerate some security considerations.

Due to the flexibility in generating maps, implementations of the _OGC API - Maps_ that are not optimized can easily encounter requests that take some time to resolve. If several of these requests are processed simultaneously, the server can become slow or unresponsive. Servers should take advantage of space partitioning structures that guarantee a deterministic maximum amount of data to process, such as the 2D Tile Matrix Set data structure (used in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF, OGC API - Tiles, GeoPackage, etc.), which results in applying cartographic generalization for regions covering a larger area. Servers should also set and apply reasonable limits (e.g., maximum width, etc.) to prevent Denial of Service attacks.

Some OGC API - Maps deployments may assign different roles to different users that may result in accessing different collections or geographical areas that can be represented as maps. The access control can be described in the OpenAPI definition as discussed in OGC API - Common (https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html#rc_oas30-security). Servers should take care that all resources in all representations and ways they can be requested (e.g., adding query parameters) are managed consistently.

Another security consideration is that maps generated by an Maps API endpoint may be positionally incorrect and potentially guide users to wrong locations. One possible way this situation could happen is the manipulation by a malicious actor of a projection library installed on a server deployment.

Using HTTPS queries is preferred to using HTTP. The obvious reason is the map response returned by the Maps API endpoint should be only accessible to the requesting user. Another reason is related to the public accessibility of the request itself. Request to a Maps API endpoint reveal geographical extents that might be associated with private or sensitive information. For instance, users commonly visit "home" or "work" or "target places" (such as holiday destinations or churches). These requests can be used to predict personal or private activities.

[big]*vii.     Legacy*

The requirements and conformance classes defined in the Maps API Standard are grounded in the work done by many OGC Members in the different versions of the OGC Web Map Service (WMS). In particular, the work of https://www.ogc.org/press-release/dr-jeff-de-la-beaujardiere-receives-ogc-lifetime-achievement-award/[Jean-François (Jeff) de La Beaujardière] was instrumental in the consolidation of WMS. He participated in the original OGC Testbeds that resulted in WMS 1.0, back in April 2000. He became the editor of all subsequent versions, including WMS 1.1, WMS 1.1.1, WMS 1.3, and ISO 19128:2005.

Key work for crafting this OGC Standard was undertaken in the Open-Earth-Monitor Cyberinfrastructure (OEMC) project (https://earthmonitor.org/). The OEMC Project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement number 101059548. 
Another project that provided key research is the All Data 4 Green Deal - An Integrated, FAIR Approach for the Common European Data Space (AD4GD) project (https://www.ad4gd.eu/). This project was co-funding by the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement number 101061001 as well as the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
Research on applying OGC API Standards for the European digital twin of the ocean is the Integrated DigitaL Framework for Comprehensive Maritime Data and Information Services (ILIAD) project (https://ocean-twin.eu/). This project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement number 101061001.

Initial implementations and an Engineering Report constituting the first draft of this standard were also produced thanks to funding from OGC Testbed 15.
