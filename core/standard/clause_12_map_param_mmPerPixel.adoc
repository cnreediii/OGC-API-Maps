== Requirements Class "Display Resolution"

=== Overview

[[maps-display-resolution-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_display_resolution.adoc[]

The Display Resolution requirements class describes how to specify an accurate physical size of a pixel for the target display device or medium with a `mm-per-pixel` parameter. This is instead of a default 0.28 mm/pixel and allows applying symbology rules correctly.
The physical pixel size is considered for establishing the relationship between the scale of the map and its output dimensions in pixels.

=== Map Operation

The Display Resolution requirements class specifies the mm-per-pixel parameter to accurately interpret scale denominators and symbology rules.

==== Parameter `mm-per-pixel`
By themselves, the width and height of the image to be presented on the display device are not enough to determine the scale of a map. This is because these values are provided in pixel units.
Conversely, the `scale-denominator` does not specify the size in pixels of a map for a given spatial area.
The scale, being the ratio between the size of features as represented on the map and the physical size of the same features, also depends on the size of display device pixels in physical units.
Knowing the size of these pixels supports accurately establishing the physical size of features as they will be presented on the display device and therefore compute the scale correctly
by dividing the actual size of the display device in physical units (e.g., millimeters) by the actual size of the extent of the map (e.g., in meters).
When this parameter is not specified, a default 0.28 mm/pixel is assumed (as standardized in WMS).

With this parameter, the server has information on the physical size of the map as presented on a display device or printed and can therefore apply styling and symbology rules accordingly.
For example, if the server receives a very small value, the server could decide to represent linear elements wider than for normal values, preventing the creation of a representation of linear features that is going to result in lines that are too thin to be correctly perceived.

==== Response
A successful GET response is described in the core class (https://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-maps-1/1.0/conf/core)

==== Error conditions

A general summary of the HTTP status codes can be found in https://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, version 1.0] as well as in https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html[OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core] Standard.

If the values of the `mm-per-pixel` parameters are out-of-range, the status code of the response will be `400`.
