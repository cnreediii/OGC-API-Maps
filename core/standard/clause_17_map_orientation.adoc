A successful GET response is described in the Maps API core class (https://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-maps-1/1.0/conf/core).

==== Error conditions

A general summary of the HTTP status codes can be found in https://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0[_OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_, version 1.0] as well as in the https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html[OGC API – Common – Part 1: Core] Standard..
