== Requirements Class "Map Tilesets"

=== Overview

[[maps-tilesets-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_tilesets.adoc[]

The Map Tilesets requirements class describes how to provide access to a map as tilesets in combination with the https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-057/20-057.html[_OGC API - Tiles_] Standard, which is based on the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[_OGC 2D Tile Matrix Set and Tileset Metadata_] Standard.
Tiles facilitate caching of data for clients and servers by requesting predefined subsets at fixed resolutions according to multi-resolution set of grids called a _TileMatrixSet_.

NOTE: WMTS was focused on map tiles (tiles that are rendered using a style). Since _OGC API - Tiles_ allows for other types of tiled data (e.g., tiled vector data and tiled coverage data),
_map tiles_ is used to refer to the WMTS 1.0 usage of tiles.

While supporting map tiles and map tilesets without conforming to this requirements class is possible, implementing this requirements class means that the tiles resources support parameters 
defined by _OGC API - Maps_ in the following requirement classes:

- Background (`bgcolor` and `transparent` parameter),
- Display Resolution (`mm-per-pixel`),
- Spatial subsetting (only if a vertical dimension is available, since the 2D Tile Matrix Sets already handle partitioning the other two dimensions, and only for `subset` and `subset-crs` parameters),
- General subsetting (`subset` for dimensions beyond spatial and temporal),
- Scaling (`scale-denomimator`, `width` and `height` which will override the usual `tileWidth` and `tileHeight` of the requested tile in pixels from the tile matrix, but those values are still used for calculating the geospatial bounding box corresponding to each tile),

NOTE: _OGC API - Tiles_ defines its own equivalent requirements class for temporal subsetting.



=== Link from data resource
A map resource can be accessed as tiles if the API implementation instance exposes a link to map tilesets in the resource that is available as map tiles.

=== Map Tileset
A tileset contains the necessary metadata to enable a client application to formulate a tile request from a single geospatial data resource.

==== Operation

The operations to retrieve a list of tilesets, individual tilesets and individual tiles are described respectively in the Tilesets List, TileSet and Core
requirements classes of the _OGC API - Tiles_ Standard.

The Map Tileset requirements class specifies that the query parameters of the GET request to individual map tiles support additional parameters as defined in the  _background_, _display resolution_, _spatial subsetting_ (if a vertical dimension is available), _general subsetting_, and _scaling_ requirements classes.

include::requirements/tilesets/REQ_tiles-parameters.adoc[]

==== Response

Successful GET responses to requests for a list of map tilesets, an individual map tileset, and map tiles are described in the corresponding requirements
class of the _OGC API - Tiles_ Standard. The response to map tiles requests shall also reflect the parameters as specified in the operation requirement.
